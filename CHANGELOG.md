# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Package scaffold: private, `node:test` only, no dependencies.
- `build.sh` + `lib/` + `src/`: shipped scripts are generated from `src/` + `lib/` fragments;
  `test/build.test.mjs` fails on drift (fresh build vs committed root script), on a stray root
  script, and when a malformed input (bad or missing marker, nested include, no final newline, a NUL byte,
  `src/build.sh`, an OUTDIR of `src/` or `lib/`, a `bash -n` failure, a later script failing) does not
  abort closed (exit 2, file named on stderr, no output changed, no temp leftovers). The drift check
  also compares the exec bits.
- `test/inlining-budget-diff.test.mjs`: `--self-test` exact count (43), an unmodified-copy
  baseline, and 12 mutant rows that must each turn the self-test red.

### Changed

- `inlining-budget-diff.sh` is now generated from `src/` + `lib/`; the output is byte-identical to
  7f0ba7b (sha256 740da13b...).
